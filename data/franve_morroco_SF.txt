France 2–0 Morocco

2022 FIFA World Cup | Semi-Final | 2022.12.14

⚽ Theo Hernández 5’
⚽ Randal Kolo Muani 79’

Introduction

France entered this semi-final confident in their direct, efficient attacking style. Morocco, the surprise team of the tournament, relied on compact defensive systems, disciplined pressing, and fast counter-attacks that had eliminated Belgium, Spain and Portugal. France scored very early, forcing Morocco to abandon their usual low-block approach. Morocco adapted admirably with aggressive possession phases and sustained pressure, but France remained calm, defended smartly inside their penalty area, and finished the match with a late second goal on a transition.

Performance Indicators

Possession:
Morocco had extended spells of possession after conceding early, building patiently from the back, especially in the second half. France were comfortable playing without the ball, choosing moments to advance rather than controlling tempo.

Chance Creation:
Morocco produced dangerous sequences around the penalty area through wide overloads and quick interchanges. France created fewer overall chances but generated higher-value moments through speed and direct running.

Shape Changes:
France maintained a consistent 4-2-3-1 structure, occasionally dropping into a back five when defending deep. Morocco started in a 5-4-1, then shifted into a 4-3-3 after going a goal down, pushing full-backs higher to chase the match.

Match Analysis
In Possession: France

Direct penetration on early attacks
The first goal came from aggressive forward running and fast combination play. Griezmann’s central positioning and the cut-back to Hernandez exposed Morocco before they could settle into their defensive structure. That early finish instantly changed the game dynamic.

Targeted transitions
France rarely tried to dominate with long passing sequences. Instead, they waited for Moroccan mistakes, then attacked directly, often through Mbappé’s diagonal runs or Griezmann’s forward movement into half-spaces.

Control through game management
France slowed tempo, absorbed pressure and played simple passes when protecting their lead. Their midfield double pivot screened central zones, inviting Morocco wide and keeping the middle of the pitch secure.

Late decisive moment
The second goal arrived after a broken play, when Mbappé’s dribble forced defensive scrambling and Kolo Muani arrived at the far post. It was not complicated — just decisive awareness in a chaotic moment, effectively sealing the match.

In Possession: Morocco

Positional bravery after early setback
After conceding, Morocco increased central presence by pushing midfielders higher and involving full-backs in progression. Ziyech and Boufal rotated positions to overload wide lanes and create crossing angles.

Final third entries
Morocco entered France’s penalty area frequently through short passing around the box, especially on the right. Their most threatening moments came from crosses, cut-backs and shots from second balls.

Lack of finishing precision
Despite sustained pressure phases, Morocco lacked a clinical final touch. France blocked shots, cleared low crosses and forced attackers into wide finishing angles. Morocco built promising play but rarely tested Lloris with high-quality attempts on goal.

Structural risk late
Chasing an equaliser pushed Morocco into a stretched shape. Full-backs advanced very high, leaving space behind. France capitalised on this gap for the second goal.

Defensive Organisation

France:
Compact and disciplined inside the box, prioritising clearances and anticipating crosses. Centre-backs won duels and blocked straight-line shooting angles. The midfield shield prevented Morocco from creating central combinations.

Morocco:
Initially compact, with centre-back lines stepping aggressively when defending around the box. After switching shape, the defensive unit became more expansive, which allowed France transition opportunities.

Game-State Management

France handled momentum swings calmly. The early lead let them dictate strategic tempo rather than ball possession. Morocco committed players forward bravely and controlled long stretches, but France absorbed pressure, trusted defensive structure, and finished decisive moments.

The second goal rewarded patience and composure, ending Moroccan belief just as they appeared closest to equalising.

Discussion

This semi-final showed the contrast between territorial dominance and scoreboard efficiency. Morocco progressed play well and pinned France deep but lacked decisive finishing. France did not need control to win — they needed clarity, discipline, and brutality in the moments that mattered.

Morocco demonstrated tactical courage, evolving shape mid-match and maintaining possession against one of the world’s strongest teams. France demonstrated knockout maturity.

Conclusion

France advanced to the World Cup final through defensive resilience and clinical attacking in high-value moments. Morocco fought bravely, controlled possession and pushed France deep, but decisive quality in both penalty areas separated the sides. France’s 2–0 win reflected elite game-state management and finishing precision under pressure.
