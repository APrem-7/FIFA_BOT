Introduction

Argentina entered this semi-final looking to reach their first World Cup final since 2014. Croatia, finalists in 2018, were again controlling games through possession and midfield overloads. Croatia dominated the early exchanges with the ball, but Argentina established control through compact defensive organisation and lethal counter-attacking. Argentina scored twice in five first-half minutes, then closed the game out with a structural switch in the second half.

Performance Indicators

Possession:

Croatia dominated possession for long periods, particularly in the opening 30 minutes and then after going behind, but struggled to turn ball circulation into high-value chances.

Chance Creation:

Croatia built in wide areas but created very few clear scoring opportunities throughout the match.

Argentina produced their best threats through direct attacks, transitions and runs into space from Álvarez.

Shape Changes:

Argentina alternated between a 4-4-2 in possession and a compact low block out of possession.

Croatia used a 4-3-3, later shifting to a 4-2-3-1 to chase the game.

Match Analysis
In Possession: Argentina
Building against Croatia’s low block

Argentina started in a 4-4-2, but Rodrigo De Paul frequently moved inside, creating a midfield three with Leandro Paredes as pivot and Enzo Fernández as a number eight. Both full-backs advanced high to provide width. Alexis Mac Allister moved inside, acting as a secondary number 10 with Messi. Julián Álvarez stretched the Croatia back line by continually running in behind.

Argentina protected central build-up lanes with their midfield triangle and controlled possession in deeper zones. This gave them enough structure to resist Croatia’s pressing while creating central occupation for Messi and Mac Allister between midfield and defence.

Early struggles with Croatia’s back five

Croatia converted into a back five without the ball, with Mario Pašalić dropping to track Nicolás Tagliafico. Central access became limited. Messi often dropped deeper to receive possession, but this reduced Argentina’s presence between the lines in the opening half hour.

Argentina’s breakthrough came not from patient build-up, but via a direct ball in behind, resulting in a penalty won by Álvarez. Messi converted. Minutes later, Argentina doubled the lead from a transition after a Croatian corner — avoiding the low block entirely.

Counter-attacks from deep

Holding a two-goal lead, Argentina dropped into a low block. Their threat came on transitions into the wide spaces that Croatia’s high full-backs left exposed. De Paul and Mac Allister often initiated counters from deep positions, finding Messi centrally or a midfield runner.

Álvarez repeatedly attacked the inside channels between Croatia’s centre-backs, using pace to stretch and pin the defensive line during transitions.

Switch to a back five

After replacing Paredes with Lisandro Martínez, Argentina shifted to a 5-3-2. Tagliafico and Molina became wing-backs, De Paul and Mac Allister tucked into central midfield, and Argentina matched Croatia’s midfield three man-for-man.

Croatia continued to dominate possession, but penetration became even harder. Messi and Álvarez paired as a front two and linked brilliantly, culminating in Messi’s solo dribble and cut-back for the third goal that effectively finished the contest.

In Possession: Croatia
Central midfield overload

Zlatko Dalić set Croatia up in a 4-3-3 with Kramarić dropping into midfield. This created advantages for Modrić and Kovačić in central zones, especially against Argentina’s initial midfield two. Wingers Perišić and Pašalić remained high, with full-backs advancing to create wide overloads.

Croatia progressed well into wide areas early, but lacked final-third quality.

Converted back line

At times, one Croatian midfielder dropped between the centre-backs to form a temporary back three. The full-backs stayed high, giving Modrić and Kovačić space to control possession and drive forward. Despite long spells with the ball, Croatia generated very few quality chances before halftime.

Change of shape

Croatia switched to a 4-2-3-1 in the second half. Modrić and Kovačić became a double pivot to secure rest defence against counters. Perišić and Juranović pushed forward to combine wide, attempting to isolate Argentina’s wing-backs.

Kramarić played off Petković, acting as an intermediate option for central progression.

Central combinations

With Argentina sitting deep, Croatia began finding more central passing options by bringing wingers inside and creating narrow attacking units around the forwards. Full-backs then held wider positions to progress play around the outside.

Argentina defended compactly, crowding central zones, blocking final balls, and forcing Croatia into low-percentage shots and crosses. Despite heavy possession, Croatia rarely threatened the goal, struggling to hit the target.

Argentina saw the match out calmly and professionally to reach the World Cup final.

Discussion

This match demonstrated that possession dominance without penetration is largely ineffective in knockout tournament football if transitions and game-state management are handled well. Argentina controlled the big moments and leveraged lead protection tactics, while Croatia circulated the ball cleanly but lacked creativity in key attacking zones.

Argentina’s flexible structure — switching between 4-4-2, low block, back five and direct attack — maximised their strengths and neutralised Croatia’s midfield.

Conclusion

Argentina became the first finalists of World Cup 2022, using a blend of compact defensive organisation, transitional threat, and structural adaptability. Croatia’s controlled possession was met with effective resistance, exemplary countering, and clinical finishing. Despite Croatia’s midfield quality and extended ball control, Argentina’s superior execution in decisive scenarios settled the match 3–0.
