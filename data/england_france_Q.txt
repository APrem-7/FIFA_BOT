⚽ Harry Kane 54’ (P)
⚽ Olivier Giroud 78’

Introduction

England came into this quarter-final with a confident, possession-dominant style built around controlled midfield play and progressive wide movement. France, defending champions from 2018, were comfortable playing more direct and relying on their elite forward line to decide key moments. The game developed into a classic knockout scenario: one team controlling the ball, the other controlling the scoreboard. England equalised from a penalty early in the second half but couldn’t convert their pressure into a turning point, while France capitalised with a decisive late strike.

Performance Indicators

Possession:
England dominated possession for large sections of the match, particularly after falling behind and again after equalising. France played without panic, often sitting compact and triggering fast attacking sequences.

Chance Creation:
England generated more shooting opportunities overall, especially through play on the right flank with overlaps and combination play around the box. France created fewer chances but produced higher-value moments, including both goals from central attacking channels.

Shape Changes:
England primarily maintained a 4-3-3 shape, with Bellingham drifting between lines and Saka receiving high and wide on the right. France set up in a 4-2-3-1, keeping two pivots to control transitions, then adjusted deeper as game-state demanded.

Match Analysis
In Possession: England

Central dominance and ball circulation
England worked possession through a three-man midfield, with Rice anchoring and Henderson plus Bellingham operating between lines. Full-backs provided width, while Kane dropped to link play. The central build was clean, allowing England to enter the final third frequently.

Right-side progression
Bukayo Saka provided England’s best attacking outlet. Repeated isolation against France’s full-back generated dribbles, fouls and penalty-box entries. The equaliser came from Saka’s direct carry, drawing a foul and resulting in a penalty converted by Kane.

Final-third limitations
Despite territorial control, England struggled to convert possession into open-play goals. Many attacks stalled around the area due to compact French defending and lack of decisive final passes. England relied heavily on set-pieces and penalty situations for clear chances.

In Possession: France

Compact build and direct threat
France often bypassed England’s midfield by playing vertically into Giroud or into channels for Mbappé. Although they had less ball control, their attacks carried immediate danger. Tchouaméni’s opening goal came from direct central progression and a long-range strike.

Second-phase attacking
France picked their moments to commit bodies forward, especially after recovering loose balls. Griezmann drifted between lines to connect midfield and attack, deciding critical moments with incisive passes.

Clinical execution
The winning goal came from a quick attacking sequence: ball wide, cross delivered early, and Giroud finishing with power and timing. France didn’t need volume — they relied on quality.

Defensive Organisation

England:
Used a mid-block, pushing midfield tight to prevent central French combinations. Walker tracked Mbappé effectively in wide areas to limit one-v-one damage. England defended well overall but were undone by two key central defensive lapses.

France:
Dropped into two tight banks, protecting the box and forcing England to build outside. Their centre-backs dealt well with crosses and physical duels. France accepted sustained pressure but trusted their structure to block shooting lanes and minimise high-quality looks.

Game-State Management

After England equalised, momentum shifted strongly in their favour. France weathered that period without panic, then slowed the tempo and won decisive territory on transitions. England’s late penalty miss prevented a potential extra-time swing, while France controlled the final minutes professionally.

Discussion

This match highlighted the difference between possession and penetration. England controlled the ball and field position, but France controlled the decisive moments. Knockout football punishes inefficiency — England came close but lacked the ruthless edge required to survive at this level. France stayed flexible, trusted their defensive shape and attacked with clarity when opportunities appeared.

Conclusion

France advanced to the World Cup semi-final using defensive compactness, clear transition patterns and elite individual match-winners. England delivered one of their most controlled tournament performances in midfield but ultimately missed the chance to capitalise on their dominance. Two clutch finishes made the difference, securing a 2–1 win and sending France into the last four.
