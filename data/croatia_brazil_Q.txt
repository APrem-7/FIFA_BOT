2022 FIFA World Cup | Quarter-Final | 2022.12.09

⚽ Neymar 105’+1
⚽ Bruno Petković 117’

(🇭🇷 Croatia win 4–2 on penalties)

Introduction

Brazil entered this quarter-final as heavy favourites with a fluid attacking system and elite transition players. Croatia, finalists in 2018, relied on control through possession security and midfield organisation rather than high-tempo attacking. Brazil struggled to break Croatia’s compact block during normal time, eventually scoring through Neymar’s brilliant extra-time combination play. Croatia, however, found an equaliser late in extra time by attacking space in transition. The match went to penalties, where Croatia’s experience, composure and goalkeeper excellence decided the contest.

Performance Indicators

Possession:
Brazil controlled the ball for long periods, especially through the middle third. Croatia kept phases short early, then gradually increased their share of possession as the game progressed.

Chance Creation:
Brazil generated the majority of final-third entries, particularly through wide overloads and combinations around the box. Croatia produced very little in terms of shot volume but stayed in the match and capitalised on one decisive transition moment.

Shape Changes:
Brazil shifted fluidly between 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 with Neymar drifting centrally. Croatia began in a 4-3-3, often forming a temporary back five without the ball by dropping a midfielder to support full-back zones.

Match Analysis
In Possession: Brazil

Positional structure and probing play
Brazil built with Casemiro dropping deep to create passing angles, while Paquetá drifted forward on the right to link with wide players. Full-backs pushed high to stretch Croatia’s block, particularly on the left where Vinícius Júnior isolated defenders.

Attacking wide channels
Brazil emphasised wide combinations, using overlaps and cut-backs to draw Croatian defenders out of shape. Final-third entries were frequent, but Croatia’s tight central coverage prevented clean central shooting opportunities.

Lack of incision in normal time
Despite sustained pressure, Brazil’s finishing was uncharacteristically cautious. Most shots came from blocked central areas or forced efforts from distance. The Croatian block remained compact and disciplined for over 90 minutes.

Breakthrough in extra time
The goal came from a fast, precise central exchange: Neymar received between lines, bounced one-twos, then rounded the keeper to finish. It reflected Brazil’s best qualities — speed, improvisation, vertical combination play — but came late due to Croatia’s resistance.

In Possession: Croatia

Controlled recycling and midfield ball security
Croatia methodically circulated possession, using Modrić, Brozović and Kovačić to dictate tempo. Their priority was to protect the ball rather than force penetration. This slowed Brazil’s rhythm and prevented transitions against them.

Wide progressions without end product
Croatia attempted to build through full-back advances and winger support but produced little in terms of clear shots. Their possession often stalled because Brazil blocked central combinations effectively until late in the match.

Reaction after falling behind
Conceding forced Croatia to take calculated risks. They committed more players high into wide zones, and midfielders drove forward with possession rather than recycling.

Late equaliser in transition
The tying goal came from a direct break down the left, exploiting the space Brazil left after committing men forward. Petković finished a cut-back with a deflected shot to level the match, demonstrating Croatia’s ability to stay alive and punish overextension.

Defensive Organisation

Brazil:
Defended high, using Casemiro to screen central lanes. Centre-backs stepped aggressively into midfield to cut passes toward Croatia’s forwards. Their structure controlled most Croatian attacking moves but was undone by one late counter.

Croatia:
Played one of the most compact defensive performances of the tournament. The midfield three constantly shifted laterally to deny through balls and prevent Brazil from receiving between the lines. Full-backs stayed narrow, reducing space for central cut-backs.

Game-State Management

Croatia’s tournament strength is game maturity. They stayed calm under pressure, extended phases, and slowed tempo to frustrate Brazil. Once Brazil scored in extra time, Croatia attacked with calculated directness, not desperation. The late equaliser altered the psychological balance completely.

In penalties, Croatia were disciplined and clinical. The goalkeeper’s saves and veteran composure from their takers ended Brazil’s run.

Discussion

The match demonstrated how defensive cohesion and emotional resilience can neutralise elite attacking talent in knockout football. Brazil dominated large stretches but could not finish the game when on top. Croatia, meanwhile, played the long game — protect space, survive waves of pressure, then take advantage of a moment.

This was a tactical contrast: Brazil relied on creativity and improvisation; Croatia relied on stability, structure and patience. When the game demanded composure under maximum pressure, Croatia delivered.

Conclusion

Croatia advanced to the semi-final by executing a disciplined defensive game plan, maintaining midfield control through experienced operators, and showing exceptional mental strength in extra time and penalties. Brazil performed well in possession but lacked the decisive finishing needed to close a knockout tie. Croatia’s resilience and game-management secured a 1–1 draw and 4–2 triumph on penalties, eliminating one of the tournament favourites.
